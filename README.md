# Stroke Transcriptomic Analysis (Work in Progress)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing transcriptomic patterns from the GSE16561 dataset to explore molecular signatures associated with stroke.  
It is intended solely for research purposes and hypothesis generation.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Import and preprocess gene expression data from GSE16561  
- Explore transcriptomic patterns associated with stroke  
- Apply feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., PCA, DE analysis)  
- Develop analytical pipelines to generate hypotheses for further research  
- Document the workflow for reproducibility and clarity

## 🚀 Planned Steps / Roadmap
1. Explore the dataset (quality control, summary statistics)  
2. Preprocess and normalize gene expression values  
3. Feature selection / dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, DE analysis)  
4. Train baseline ML models (Elastic Net regression, Random Forest)  
5. Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC)  
6. Package models into reusable scripts/modules  
7. Visualize results (e.g., feature importance, confusion matrices)  
8. Document the pipeline for reproducibility  

---

## 📦 Installation (Coming Soon)
Instructions for installing dependencies and running scripts will be added once the pipeline is functional.

## 🧠 Notes
This project is intended as a **portfolio piece** to demonstrate:
- Structured project planning  
- Reproducible data analysis  
- Machine learning pipeline development  
- Code organization and modularity  
- Experience working with real bioinformatics datasets (GEO microarray data)
